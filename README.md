# React Router v6: Unexpected Behavior with Identical Components Across Routes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router v6 related to navigating between routes that render identical components.  The issue arises when components are reused across different routes, leading to potential problems with state updates and re-rendering.

## Bug Description
When navigating to different routes which use the same component, the component may not re-render, causing stale props or state to persist.  This can lead to unexpected application behavior and data inconsistencies.  This issue is not readily apparent and can be difficult to debug.

## Reproduction
The `bug.js` file contains a simple React application using React Router v6.  Navigate between the Home, About, and Contact routes; these routes may render seemingly the same component, but the different paths will trigger the unexpected behavior in the component's re-render or state management.  Note that although the displayed content is identical across routes, this is a simplification of a larger scenario where this behavior may be less easily observable.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that uses unique keys to force re-renders based on the route parameters.  This ensures that the component always re-renders correctly based on the route it is rendered on.
